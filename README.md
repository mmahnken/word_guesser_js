word_guesser_js
===============

a simple word guesser in javascript


One of my earliest javascript projects at the beginning of my fellowship at Hackbright Academy. 
Functions similarly to hangman.


Input: letters!
Output: Logs letters you've guessed and how many more letters needed to complete the word. Issues a "Guess again"
when there are more letters to guess, until you win the game.
